# Depth-First Search

## Motivation: Maze Exploration
**Maze Graph**
- Vertex = Intersection.
- Edge = passage connecting intersections.

**Goal** Explore every intersection (vertex in graph) in the maze.

**Algorithm: Tr√©maux maze exploration**
- Unroll a ball of string behind you.
- Mark each visited intersection and each visited passage.
- Retrace steps when no unvisited options.

## Depth-First Search Intuition

**Goal** Systematically search through a graph.

**Idea** Mimic maze exploration.

```pseudocode
DFS (to visit a vertex v)
Mark v as visited.
Recursively visit all unmarked vertices w adjacent to v.
```

**Applications**
- Find all vertices connected to a given source vertex.
- Find a path between two vertices.

## Design Pattern for Graph Processing

**Design pattern** Decouple graph data type from graph processing.

- Create a Graph object `graph`.
- Pass `graph` to a graph-processing routine.
- Query the graph-processing routine for information.

## Depth-First Search: Data Structures

To visit a vertex $v$, we need to:
- Mark $v$ as visited.
- Recursively visit all the unmarked vertices adjacent to $v$

**Data Structures**
- An array `boolean[] visited = new boolean[V]` to store the information of
the vertex traversal history.
- An array `edgeTo[v]` to store the path information, for instance,
`edgeTo[v1] = v2` means the graph search algorithm visits vertex `v1` via
edge `v2-v1` for the first time.
- A function call-stack for recursion.

## Depth-First Search Properties

***Proposition*** DFS marks all vertices connected to `src` in time proportional
to the sum of their degrees. (plus time to initialize the `visited[]` array.

**Proof of Correctness**
- If $w$ marked, then $w$ connected to $s$, because the only way to mark a vertex
is to get there through a sequence of recursive calls, and every recursive calls
corresponds to an edge on a path from $s$ to $w$.
- If $w$ connected to $s$, then $w$ marked. (If $w$ is unmarked, then consider
last edge on a path from $s$ to $w$ that goes from a marked vertex to an unmarked
one.

**Proof of Running Time**
- Each vertex connected to $s$ is visited exactly once.
