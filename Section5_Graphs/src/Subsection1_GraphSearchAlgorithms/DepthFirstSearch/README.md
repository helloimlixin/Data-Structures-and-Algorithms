# Depth-First Search

## Motivation: Maze Exploration
**Maze Graph**
- Vertex = Intersection.
- Edge = passage connecting intersections.

**Goal** Explore every intersection (vertex in graph) in the maze.

**Algorithm: Tr√©maux maze exploration**

## Depth-First Search Properties

***Proposition*** DFS makrs all vertices connected to $s$ in time proportional
to the sum of their degrees.

**Proof of Correctness**
